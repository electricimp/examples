## Recent Examples

### [impMonitor](./impMonitor)
This example demonstrates the use of the impCentral™ API to retrieve information about your development devices and use that data to generate a live web-based status readout via HTML, JavaScript and jQuery.
##### Updated March 01, 2018

### [searchXML](./searchXML)
This example contains a function used for searching for a specific path within an XML string. It supports sibling tags with the same name but does not support nested tags with the same name. It can be used synchronously or asynchronously and the README contains examples of both.
##### Updated November 16, 2017

### [Thermocouple](./Thermocouple)
This example has simple code for reading temperature from a thermocouple click board and also an application that sends temperature data to Initial State. The thermocouple runs on 3.3v. The range of the thermocouple is -270 to 1372 degrees celsius. These examples are written for use with an impAccelerator Fielbus Gateway, but can be easily modified for use with any imp.
##### Updated Sept 11, 2017

### [ArduCAM OV2640 Example](./ArduCAM_OV2640_Example)
This example contains a facial recognition application and a driver class for the OV2640 ArduCAM. The camera driver can be used to develop other camera applications. The facial recognition application uses the Kairos Facial Recognition API to detect and recognize faces. To run this application you will need to set up an account on Kairos.
##### Updated August 24, 2017

### [GoogleCalendar](./GoogleCalendar)
This is example code for using the imp with Google Calendar. The example provided allows you to schedule turning on lights on the device (an imp explorer kit) by adding an event titled "lights" to your calendar. The example code, however, also provides methods within a GoogleCalendar class which let you schedule, modify, delete, and view events from your calendar. By setting them up with ```device.on``` calls from the agent and ```device.send``` calls from the device, you can perform these actions by interacting with the device as well.
##### Updated August 9, 2017

### [Intro to Squirrel Applications](./Intro%20to%20Squirrel%20Applications)
A series of eight examples for use with the sensors on the impExplorer Developer Kit or impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node. These examples range from simple to advanced programming.  Each example builds on the skills learned in the previous example. Please note that the first few examples are not power efficient and will drain battery powered devices quickly. 
##### Updated June 29, 2017

### [SensorNode_BatteryCheck](./SensorNode_BatteryCheck/)
This example was written for the Battery Powered Sensor Node to determine the battery voltage. The battery class included in this example can be used for other devices as long as there is an analog pin that is connected directly to the battery. **Please note** this code is not usable for determining the battery voltage on the impExplorer Developer Kit, since no analog pins are connected directly to the battery.
